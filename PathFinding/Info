Type of algorithm

	Breadth First Search

	One source, one destination:
		Greedy Best First Search
		A* - commonly used in games
	One source, all destinations, or all sources, one destination:
		Breadth First Search - unweighted edges
		Dijkstra’s Algorithm - adds weights to edges
		Bellman-Ford - supports negative weights
	All sources, all destinations:
		Floyd-Warshall
		Johnson’s Algorithm
